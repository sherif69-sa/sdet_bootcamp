SDETKit is a layered **release-confidence and engineering-operations toolkit**. It helps teams move from scattered checks to deterministic workflows, evidence, and repeatable operator experience—so "ready to ship" is a verifiable decision, not a subjective one.

## Why this exists

Most repositories accumulate separate scripts and tools, but the release decision still depends on manual interpretation. SDETKit provides a consistent command path from quick confidence to strict release gating, with machine-readable evidence and CI-safe outcomes.

## Start here

Choose the path that matches where you are now:

### 0) Decide if SDETKit is a fit

- Decision guide: `docs/decision-guide.md`

### 1) Evaluate a repository quickly

```bash
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh quick
```

- Fast confidence check with deterministic pass/fail output.
- Good first run before deeper enforcement.
- Guide: `docs/ready-to-use.md`

### 2) Run stricter release-confidence checks

```bash
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh release
```

- Runs a stricter go/no-go lane (quality + security + release gate flow).
- Use before release decisions.
- Overview: `docs/release-confidence.md`

### 3) Understand the broader system and command surface

- Representative adopter walkthrough: `docs/example-adoption-flow.md`
- Full command map: `docs/command-taxonomy.md`
- CLI command reference: `docs/cli.md`

## Who this is for

- **SDET / QA teams** that need reproducible quality and release gates.
- **DevOps / platform teams** that want policy-aware checks in CI.
- **Maintainers and release owners** who need evidence-backed release decisions.

## Why not just separate tools?

- Separate tools can run checks; SDETKit standardizes the operator workflow, output shape, and decision path so teams get repeatable release outcomes.
- SDETKit keeps proof artifacts and governance-oriented outputs close to execution, instead of leaving integration and interpretation fully ad hoc.

## Core commands

```bash
# Fast confidence lane
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh quick

# Strict release-confidence lane
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh release

# Direct CLI gates
python -m sdetkit gate fast
python -m sdetkit gate release

# Security budget enforcement
python -m sdetkit security enforce --format json --max-error 0 --max-warn 0 --max-info 0
```

Explore broader command domains (`doctor`, `repo`, `security`, `evidence`, `report`, `ops`):

```bash
python -m sdetkit --help
python -m sdetkit playbooks
```

## Installation

### Runtime install

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

### Developer install (recommended)

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Optional extras

```bash
python -m pip install .[dev]
python -m pip install .[test]
python -m pip install .[packaging]
```

## CI/CD integration

For teams adopting SDETKit in another repository, start with:

- `docs/adoption.md` for copy-paste local and GitHub Actions workflows.
- `docs/recommended-ci-flow.md` for the recommended baseline CI shape (PR fast feedback, stricter `main`, release-oriented checks).
- First gate: `python -m sdetkit gate fast`
- Stricter rollout: security budgets + `python -m sdetkit gate release`

For CI failure triage in this repository's GitHub Actions runs, inspect uploaded artifacts:

- `ci-gate-diagnostics` (`build/gate-fast.json`, `build/security-enforce.json`)
- `release-diagnostics` (`build/release-preflight.json`)

For an immediate "downloaded artifact -> next fix step" path, use the artifact-to-action map in `docs/adoption-troubleshooting.md`.

### Jenkins

See `examples/ci/jenkins/`.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t sdetkit .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work sdetkit python -m sdetkit gate fast
```

## Release posture note

This repository is prepared for artifact build and release validation. Public PyPI publication depends on `PYPI_API_TOKEN` configuration and successful workflow execution; this README does not claim generally available PyPI distribution by default.

For first-public-release and post-release external verification steps, follow `RELEASE.md` and `docs/releasing.md`. After real releases are verified externally, see `docs/release-verification.md` for published evidence records.
