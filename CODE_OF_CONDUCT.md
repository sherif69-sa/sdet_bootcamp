## Reporting an incident

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the maintainer privately.

When reporting, include:

- Where and when it happened.
- Any evidence (screenshots/logs) if available.
- Whether there is an immediate safety concern.

## Enforcement

All reports are reviewed seriously and handled as confidentially as possible.

Potential actions may include warning, temporary restrictions, or removal from community spaces depending on severity and recurrence.
