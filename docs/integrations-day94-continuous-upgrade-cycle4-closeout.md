# Continuous Upgrade Cycle 4 Closeout — Continuous upgrade closeout lane

Day 94 starts the next cycle by converting Day 93 publication outcomes into a deterministic continuous-upgrade lane.

## Why Continuous Upgrade Cycle 4 matters

- Converts Day 93 publication artifacts into a repeatable execution loop for ongoing repository upgrades.
- Protects quality with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, KPI thresholds, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 94 closeout into the continuous-upgrade backlog.

## Required inputs (Day 93)

- `docs/artifacts/day93-continuous-upgrade-cycle3-closeout-pack/day93-continuous-upgrade-cycle3-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day93-continuous-upgrade-cycle3-closeout-pack/day93-delivery-board.md`
- `docs/roadmap/plans/day94-continuous-upgrade-cycle4-plan.json`

## Command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day94-continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout --format json --strict  # legacy alias
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day94-continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day94-continuous-upgrade-cycle4-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day94_continuous_upgrade_cycle4_closeout_contract.py
```

## Continuous upgrade contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for continuous-upgrade execution and signoff (legacy Day 94).
- The Day 94 lane references Day 93 outcomes, controls, and trust continuity signals.
- Every Day 94 section includes docs/template CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Day 94 closeout records continuous upgrade outputs, report publication status, and backlog inputs.

## Continuous upgrade quality checklist

- [ ] Includes baseline evidence coverage, objection segmentation assumptions, and response SLA targets
- [ ] Every upgrade lane row has owner, execution window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to upgrade docs/templates + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures continuous upgrade adoption delta, confidence, and rollback owner
- [ ] Artifact pack includes upgrade brief, evidence plan, template diffs, outcome ledger, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 94 delivery board

- [ ] Day 94 evidence brief committed
- [ ] Day 94 continuous upgrade plan committed
- [ ] Day 94 upgrade template upgrade ledger exported
- [ ] Day 94 storyline outcomes ledger exported
- [ ] Next-cycle roadmap draft captured from Day 94 outcomes

## Scoring model

Day 94 weights continuity + execution contract + upgrade artifact readiness for a 100-point activation score.
