# Onboarding Activation Closeout (Legacy Day 63) — Contributor onboarding activation closeout lane

> Legacy alias: `day63-onboarding-activation-closeout` remains supported; prefer `onboarding-activation-closeout` in active usage.

Day 63 closes with a major onboarding activation upgrade that turns Day 62 community operations evidence into deterministic contributor activation, ownership handoffs, and roadmap voting execution.

## Why Onboarding Activation Closeout matters

- Converts Day 62 community momentum into repeatable onboarding and mentor ownership loops.
- Protects onboarding outcomes with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 63 onboarding activation to Day 64 contributor pipeline acceleration.
