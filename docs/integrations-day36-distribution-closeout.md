# Day 36 — Community distribution closeout

Day 36 closes the distribution lane by converting the Day 35 KPI story into channel-ready messaging, schedule commitments, and Day 37 experiments.

## Why Day 36 matters

- Converts KPI insights into public distribution execution.
- Protects consistency by defining owner, backup reviewer, and posting windows.
- Creates a direct handoff from distribution misses into Day 37 experiment backlog.
