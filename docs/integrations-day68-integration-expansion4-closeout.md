# Day 68 — Integration expansion #4 closeout lane

Day 68 closes with a major integration upgrade that converts Day 67 outputs into a self-hosted enterprise Tekton reference.

## Why Day 68 matters

- Converts Day 67 governance outputs into reusable self-hosted implementation patterns.
- Protects integration outcomes with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 68 integration expansion to Day 69 case-study prep #1.

## Required inputs (Day 67)

- `docs/artifacts/day67-integration-expansion3-closeout-pack/day67-integration-expansion3-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day67-integration-expansion3-closeout-pack/day67-delivery-board.md`
- `templates/ci/tekton/day68-self-hosted-reference.yaml`

## Integration expansion contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 68 self-hosted enterprise rollout and signoff.
- The Day 68 lane references Day 67 integration expansion outputs, governance decisions, and KPI continuity signals.
- Every Day 68 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Day 68 closeout records self-hosted pipeline stages, identity controls, runner policy strategy, and Day 69 case-study prep priorities.

## Integration quality checklist

- [ ] Includes self-hosted stages + policy conditions, queue/parallel fan-out, and rollback trigger
- [ ] Every section has owner, review window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to docs + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures pipeline pass-rate, median runtime, queue saturation, confidence, and recovery owner
- [ ] Artifact pack includes integration brief, self-hosted blueprint, policy plan, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 68 delivery board
