# Day 37 — Experiment lane activation

Day 37 turns Day 36 distribution misses into controlled experiments with strict scoring, owner accountability, and Day 38 rollout decisions.

## Why Day 37 matters

- Converts distribution misses into measurable learnings instead of ad-hoc retries.
- Protects quality by coupling growth experiments to reliability and contribution guardrails.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from experiment outcomes into Day 38 distribution actions.

## Required inputs (Day 36)

- `docs/artifacts/day36-distribution-closeout-pack/day36-distribution-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day36-distribution-closeout-pack/day36-delivery-board.md`

## Day 37 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit day37-experiment-lane --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day37-experiment-lane --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day37-experiment-lane-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day37-experiment-lane --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day37-experiment-lane-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day37_experiment_lane_contract.py
```

## Experiment contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for experiment execution and decision logging.
- At least three experiments include hypothesis, KPI target delta, and stop/continue threshold.
- Every experiment is linked to one Day 36 distribution miss with explicit remediation intent.
- Day 37 report commits Day 38 distribution batch actions based on experiment outcomes.

## Experiment quality checklist

- [ ] Includes at least three experiments with control vs variant definitions
- [ ] Every experiment has KPI target, owner, and decision deadline
- [ ] Guardrail metrics include reliability and contribution-quality checks
- [ ] Experiment scorecard records baseline, current, and delta fields
- [ ] Artifact pack includes matrix, hypothesis brief, scorecard, and decision log

## Day 37 delivery board

- [ ] Day 37 experiment matrix committed
- [ ] Day 37 hypothesis brief reviewed with owner + backup
- [ ] Day 37 scorecard snapshot exported
- [ ] Day 38 distribution batch actions selected from winners
- [ ] Day 38 fallback plan documented for losing variants

## Scoring model

Day 37 weighted score (0-100):

- Docs contract + command lane completeness: 30 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 36 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 35 points.
- Experiment contract lock + delivery board readiness: 15 points.
