# Day 33 — Demo asset #1 production

Day 33 closes the first distribution-ready demo asset, turning Day 32 release readiness into externally consumable proof.

## Why Day 33 matters

- Demonstrates real value with a concise `doctor` workflow narrative.
- Creates a repeatable media pipeline (script → cut → publish → evidence).
- Links each demo claim to runnable CLI commands and docs for trust.

## Required inputs (Day 32)

- `docs/artifacts/day32-release-cadence-pack/day32-release-cadence-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day32-release-cadence-pack/day32-delivery-board.md`

## Day 33 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit day33-demo-asset --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day33-demo-asset --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day33-demo-asset-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day33-demo-asset --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day33-demo-asset-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day33_demo_asset_contract.py
```

## Demo production contract

- Demo owner: one accountable editor and one backup reviewer are assigned.
- Target format: publish both MP4 clip and GIF teaser for social/docs embedding.
- Runtime SLA: main demo duration stays between 45 and 90 seconds.
- Narrative shape: pain -> command -> output -> value CTA must appear in order.

## Demo quality checklist

- [ ] Shows `python -m sdetkit doctor --json` execution with readable terminal output
- [ ] Includes before/after or problem/solution framing in first 10 seconds
- [ ] Mentions one measurable trust signal (time saved, failures prevented, or coverage)
- [ ] Includes docs link and CLI command in caption or description
- [ ] Raw source file and final export are both stored in artifact pack

## Day 33 delivery board

- [ ] Day 33 script draft committed
- [ ] Day 33 first cut rendered
- [ ] Day 33 final cut + caption copy approved
- [ ] Day 34 demo asset #2 backlog pre-scoped
- [ ] Day 35 KPI instrumentation plan updated

## Scoring model

Day 33 weighted score (0-100):

- Docs contract + command lane completeness: 30 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 32 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 35 points.
- Demo contract lock + delivery board readiness: 15 points.
