# Day 43 — Acceleration closeout lane

Day 43 closes with a major acceleration upgrade that converts Day 42 optimization evidence into deterministic improvement loops.

## Why Day 43 matters

- Converts Day 42 optimization proof into growth-first operating motion.
- Protects quality with owner accountability, command proof, and KPI guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from acceleration outcomes into Day 44 scale priorities.

## Required inputs (Day 42)

- `docs/artifacts/day42-optimization-closeout-pack/day42-optimization-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day42-optimization-closeout-pack/day42-delivery-board.md`

## Day 43 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit day43-acceleration-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day43-acceleration-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day43-acceleration-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day43-acceleration-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day43-acceleration-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict

```

## Acceleration closeout contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 43 acceleration lane execution and KPI follow-up.
- The Day 43 acceleration lane references Day 42 optimization winners and misses with deterministic growth loops.
- Every Day 43 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI target, and rollout guardrail.
- Day 43 closeout records acceleration learnings and Day 44 scale priorities.

## Acceleration quality checklist

- [ ] Includes acceleration summary, growth matrix, and rollback strategy
- [ ] Every section has owner, publish window, KPI target, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to docs + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures baseline, current, delta, and confidence for each KPI
- [ ] Artifact pack includes acceleration plan, growth matrix, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 43 delivery board

- [ ] Day 43 acceleration plan draft committed
- [ ] Day 43 review notes captured with owner + backup
- [ ] Day 43 growth matrix exported
- [ ] Day 43 KPI scorecard snapshot exported
- [ ] Day 44 scale priorities drafted from Day 43 learnings

## Scoring model

Day 43 weighted score (0-100):

- Docs contract + command lane completeness: 30 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 42 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 35 points.
- Acceleration contract lock + delivery board readiness: 15 points.
