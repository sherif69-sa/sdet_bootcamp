# Day 67 — Integration expansion #3 closeout lane

Day 67 closes with a major integration upgrade that converts Day 66 integration outputs into an advanced Jenkins reference pipeline.

## Why Day 67 matters

- Converts Day 66 governance outputs into reusable Jenkins implementation patterns.
- Protects integration outcomes with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 67 integration expansion to Day 68 integration expansion #4.

## Required inputs (Day 66)

- `docs/artifacts/day66-integration-expansion2-closeout-pack/day66-integration-expansion2-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day66-integration-expansion2-closeout-pack/day66-delivery-board.md`
- `.jenkins.day67-advanced-reference.Jenkinsfile`

## Day 67 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit day67-integration-expansion3-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day67-integration-expansion3-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day67-integration-expansion3-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day67-integration-expansion3-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day67-integration-expansion3-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day67_integration_expansion3_closeout_contract.py
```

## Integration expansion contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 67 advanced Jenkins rollout and signoff.
- The Day 67 lane references Day 66 integration expansion outputs, governance decisions, and KPI continuity signals.
- Every Day 67 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Day 67 closeout records Jenkins pipeline stages, matrix controls, shared library strategy, and Day 68 integration priorities.

## Integration quality checklist

- [ ] Includes Jenkins stages + post conditions, matrix or parallel fan-out, and rollback trigger
- [ ] Every section has owner, review window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to docs + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures pipeline pass-rate, median runtime, cache efficiency, confidence, and recovery owner
- [ ] Artifact pack includes integration brief, Jenkins blueprint, matrix plan, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 67 delivery board

- [ ] Day 67 integration brief committed
- [ ] Day 67 advanced Jenkins pipeline blueprint published
- [ ] Day 67 matrix and cache strategy exported
- [ ] Day 67 KPI scorecard snapshot exported
- [ ] Day 68 integration expansion priorities drafted from Day 67 learnings

## Scoring model

Day 67 weighted score (0-100):

- Contract + command lane completeness: 25 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 66 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 30 points.
- Jenkins reference quality + guardrails: 25 points.
