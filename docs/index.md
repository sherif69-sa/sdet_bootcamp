# DevS69 SDETKit

SDETKit is a release confidence toolkit for SDET, QA, and DevOps teams that need a repeatable answer to: **"is this repo ready to ship?"**

## Start here: Stable/Core release-confidence path

Run the flagship workflow:

```bash
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh quick
```

Then run the stricter release gate:

```bash
bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh release
```

### What happens

1. Bootstrap a local environment.
2. Validate CLI health.
3. Run CI-style checks.
4. (Release mode) enforce security policy budgets and run the release gate.

### What proves value quickly

You get deterministic pass/fail output and a clear go/no-go signal you can reuse in local and CI workflows.

## Core path (recommended first-time sequence)

Use this sequence to keep rollout focused:

1. **Quick confidence** via `bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh quick`
2. **Strict release gate** via `bash scripts/ready_to_use.sh release`
3. **External adoption** via [adoption.md](adoption.md)

## Flagship workflow (manual form)

```bash
bash ci.sh quick --skip-docs
bash quality.sh cov
python -m sdetkit security enforce --format json --max-error 0 --max-warn 0 --max-info 0
python -m sdetkit gate release
```

## Where integrations and playbooks fit

- **Integrations (after core gates):** [GitHub Action](github-action.md), [Recommended CI flow](recommended-ci-flow.md), and [Adopt in your repository](adoption.md).
- **Playbooks (guided rollout):** [Global production transformation playbook](global-production-transformation-playbook.md), [First contribution quickstart](first-contribution-quickstart.md), and [Release-confidence examples](examples.md).
- **Reference depth:** [CLI](cli.md), [Command surface inventory](command-surface.md), and [Capability map](command-taxonomy.md).

## Stability levels

SDETKit documents command and workflow maturity with four levels: **Stable/Core**, **Integrations**, **Playbooks**, and **Experimental**.

- **Stable/Core** is the default production path for release confidence and shipping readiness.
- **Integrations** extend core workflows into CI, notifications, and external systems.
- **Playbooks** provide guided rollout lanes for adoption and operating practice.
- **Experimental** includes transition-era/advanced day and closeout lanes; keep as opt-in with validation.

## Legacy reports

Historical day-by-day upgrade reports remain available as transition-era context for audit trails and prior initiatives. They are intentionally secondary to the Stable/Core release-confidence journey.
