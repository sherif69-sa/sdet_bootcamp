# Narrative Closeout lane (Legacy: Day 52)

Day 52 closes with a major narrative upgrade that converts Day 51 case-snippet evidence into a deterministic release-storytelling lane.

## Why Day 52 matters

- Converts Day 51 case-snippet proof into release-storytelling discipline.
- Protects quality with owner accountability, command proof, and KPI guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from Day 52 narratives into Day 53 expansion execution.

## Required inputs (Day 51)

- `docs/artifacts/day51-case-snippet-closeout-pack/day51-case-snippet-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day51-case-snippet-closeout-pack/day51-delivery-board.md`

## Narrative Closeout command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit narrative-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit narrative-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day52-narrative-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit narrative-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day52-narrative-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict

```

## Narrative closeout contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 52 narrative execution and KPI follow-up.
- The Day 52 narrative lane references Day 51 case-snippet winners and misses with deterministic release-storytelling loops.
- Every Day 52 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI target, and rollout guardrail.
- Day 52 closeout records narrative learnings and Day 53 expansion priorities.
