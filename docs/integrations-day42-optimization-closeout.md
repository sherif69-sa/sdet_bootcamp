# Day 42 — Optimization closeout lane

Day 42 closes the lane with a major optimization upgrade that converts Day 41 expansion outcomes into deterministic remediation loops.

## Why Day 42 matters

- Turns Day 41 expansion proof into remediation-first operating motion.
- Locks quality controls while increasing repeatability and throughput.
- Produces a deterministic handoff into Day 43 acceleration priorities.

## Required inputs (Day 41)

- `docs/artifacts/day41-expansion-automation-pack/day41-expansion-automation-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day41-expansion-automation-pack/day41-delivery-board.md`

## Day 42 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit day42-optimization-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day42-optimization-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day42-optimization-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day42-optimization-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day42-optimization-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day42_optimization_closeout_contract.py
```

## Optimization closeout contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 42 optimization lane execution and KPI follow-up.
- The Day 42 optimization lane references Day 41 expansion winners and misses with deterministic remediation loops.
- Every Day 42 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI target, and rollout guardrail.
- Day 42 closeout records optimization learnings and Day 43 acceleration priorities.

## Optimization quality checklist

- [ ] Includes optimization summary, remediation matrix, and rollback strategy
- [ ] Every section has owner, publish window, KPI target, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to docs + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures baseline, current, delta, and confidence for each KPI
- [ ] Artifact pack includes optimization plan, remediation matrix, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 42 delivery board

- [ ] Day 42 optimization plan draft committed
- [ ] Day 42 review notes captured with owner + backup
- [ ] Day 42 remediation matrix exported
- [ ] Day 42 KPI scorecard snapshot exported
- [ ] Day 43 acceleration priorities drafted from Day 42 learnings

## Scoring model

Day 42 weighted score (0-100):

- Docs contract + command lane completeness: 30 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 41 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 35 points.
- Optimization execution contract lock + delivery board readiness: 15 points.
