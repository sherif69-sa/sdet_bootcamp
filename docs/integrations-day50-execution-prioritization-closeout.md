# Day 50 — Execution prioritization closeout lane

Day 50 closes with a major execution-prioritization upgrade that converts Day 49 weekly-review evidence into a deterministic execution board and release-storytelling handoff.

## Why Day 50 matters

- Converts Day 49 weekly-review proof into execution-board discipline.
- Protects quality with owner accountability, command proof, and KPI guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from execution priorities into Day 51 storytelling priorities.
