# Day 61 — Phase-3 kickoff execution closeout lane

Day 61 ships a major Phase-3 kickoff upgrade that converts Day 60 wrap evidence into a strict baseline for ecosystem + trust execution.

## Why Day 61 matters

- Converts Day 60 closeout evidence into repeatable Phase-3 execution loops.
- Protects trust outcomes with ownership, command proof, and KPI rollback guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from Day 61 kickoff into Day 62 community program setup.
