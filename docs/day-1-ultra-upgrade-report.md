# Day 1 Ultra Upgrade Report — Core Positioning Refresh

## Upgrade title

**Day 1 ultra: README positioning + role-based conversion entry system**

## Problem statement

New users arriving at the repository needed a stronger first-glance answer to three questions:

1. What exact outcome does DevS69 provide?
2. Who is this toolkit for by role?
3. What should I run first right now?

Without those answers above-the-fold, conversion from visit → first command run can drop, especially for cross-functional buyers (SDET, platform, security, management).

## Implementation scope

### Files changed

- `src/sdetkit/onboarding.py`
  - Added new runnable `sdetkit onboarding` command with role-based Day 1 paths in text/markdown/json formats.
- `src/sdetkit/cli.py`
  - Registered `onboarding` as a first-class CLI command.
- `tests/test_onboarding_cli.py`
  - Added coverage for role filtering, output formats, and top-level CLI dispatch.
- `scripts/check_onboarding_contract.py`
  - Added lightweight automation check to validate Day 1 onboarding links/snippets and docs targets.
- `scripts/check.sh`
  - Added `onboarding` check mode and included onboarding contract check in `all`.
- `docs/artifacts/day1-onboarding-sample.md`
  - Added generated sample artifact from `python -m sdetkit onboarding --format markdown`.
- `README.md`
  - Added role-driven Day 1 ultra conversion section with command-level entry points.
  - Added explicit Day 1 success criteria checklist.
  - Added cross-link to this implementation report.
- `docs/index.md`
  - Added direct navigation link to this Day 1 report.
  - Added Day 1 ultra upgrades section before Fast start.
- `docs/day-1-ultra-upgrade-report.md`
  - Added day artifact and validation record.

## Validation checklist

- `python -m pytest -q`
- `python scripts/check_onboarding_contract.py`

## Artifact

This document is the Day 1 artifact for traceability and operational handoff.

## Rollback plan

If this positioning flow needs to be reverted:

1. Revert the README Day 1 ultra block.
2. Remove the Day 1 report link and section from `docs/index.md`.
3. Delete this report document.

No code-path or runtime behavior changes are introduced, so rollback risk is low and isolated to docs surface.
