# Day 83 — Trust FAQ expansion loop closeout lane

Day 83 closes with a major upgrade that folds Day 82 integration feedback outcomes into trust FAQ coverage upgrades and escalation-readiness execution.

## Why Day 83 matters

- Turns Day 82 integration feedback outcomes into deterministic trust FAQ expansion loops across docs, templates, and support operations.
- Protects quality with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, KPI thresholds, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 83 closeout into Day 84 evidence narrative priorities.
