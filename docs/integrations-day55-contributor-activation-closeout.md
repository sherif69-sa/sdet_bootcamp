# Contributor Activation Closeout lane (Legacy: Day 55)

Day 55 closes with a major contributor activation upgrade that turns Day 53 docs-loop evidence into a deterministic contributor follow-through lane.

## Why Day 55 matters

- Converts Day 53 docs-loop wins into repeatable contributor activation motions.
- Protects quality with ownership, command proof, and KPI guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from Day 55 closeout into Day 56 planning.

## Required inputs (Day 53)

- `docs/artifacts/day53-docs-loop-closeout-pack/day53-docs-loop-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day53-docs-loop-closeout-pack/day53-delivery-board.md`

## Contributor activation contract
