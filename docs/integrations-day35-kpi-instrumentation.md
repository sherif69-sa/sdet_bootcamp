# Day 35 — KPI instrumentation closeout

Day 35 closes the week with a hardened KPI operating loop that ties growth narrative to measurable thresholds and owners.

## Why Day 35 matters

- Converts production demo momentum into persistent weekly measurement.
- Eliminates attribution blind spots with explicit source-command mapping per KPI.
- Forces decisions by pairing every drift signal with a next-week action.

## Required inputs (Day 34)

- `docs/artifacts/day34-demo-asset2-pack/day34-demo-asset2-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day34-demo-asset2-pack/day34-delivery-board.md`
