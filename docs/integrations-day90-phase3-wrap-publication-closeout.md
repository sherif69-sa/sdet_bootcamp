# Day 90 — Phase-3 wrap publication closeout lane

Day 90 closes with a major upgrade that converts Day 89 governance scale outcomes into a deterministic phase-3 wrap and publication operating lane.

## Why Day 90 matters

- Converts Day 89 governance scale outcomes into reusable publication decisions across release recap, roadmap governance, and maintainer escalation paths.
- Protects quality with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, KPI thresholds, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Day 90 closeout into the next-cycle roadmap.

## Required inputs (Day 89)

- `docs/artifacts/day89-governance-scale-closeout-pack/day89-governance-scale-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day89-governance-scale-closeout-pack/day89-delivery-board.md`
- `.day90-phase3-wrap-publication-plan.json`

## Phase-3 wrap publication contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 90 phase-3 wrap publication execution and signoff.
- The Day 90 lane references Day 89 outcomes, controls, and trust continuity signals.
- Every Day 90 section includes docs/template CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Day 90 closeout records phase-3 wrap publication outputs, final report publication status, and next-cycle roadmap inputs.

## Phase-3 wrap publication quality checklist

- [ ] Includes baseline evidence coverage, objection segmentation assumptions, and response SLA targets
- [ ] Every narrative lane row has owner, execution window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to narrative docs/templates + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures phase-3 wrap publication adoption delta, objection deflection delta, confidence, and rollback owner
- [ ] Artifact pack includes narrative brief, evidence plan, template diffs, outcome ledger, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 90 delivery board

- [ ] Day 90 evidence brief committed
- [ ] Day 90 phase-3 wrap publication plan committed
- [ ] Day 90 narrative template upgrade ledger exported
- [ ] Day 90 storyline outcomes ledger exported
- [ ] Next-cycle roadmap draft captured from Day 90 outcomes

## Scoring model

Day 90 weights continuity + execution contract + publication artifact readiness for a 100-point activation score.
