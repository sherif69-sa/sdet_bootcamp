# Stabilization Closeout lane (Legacy: Day 56)

Day 56 closes with a major stabilization upgrade that turns Day 55 contributor-activation outcomes into deterministic KPI recovery and follow-through.

## Why Day 56 matters

- Converts Day 55 contributor outcomes into repeatable stabilization loops.
- Protects quality with ownership, command proof, and KPI rollback guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from Day 56 closeout into Day 57 deep audit planning.

## Required inputs (Day 55)

- `docs/artifacts/day55-contributor-activation-closeout-pack/day55-contributor-activation-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/day55-contributor-activation-closeout-pack/day55-delivery-board.md`

## Stabilization Closeout command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit stabilization-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit stabilization-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day56-stabilization-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit stabilization-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day56-stabilization-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day56_stabilization_closeout_contract.py
```

## Stabilization contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Day 56 stabilization execution and KPI recovery.
- The Day 56 lane references Day 55 contributor activation outcomes and unresolved risks.
- Every Day 56 section includes docs CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Day 56 closeout records stabilization outcomes and Day 57 deep-audit priorities.

## Stabilization quality checklist

- [ ] Includes bottleneck digest, remediation experiments, and rollback strategy
- [ ] Every section has owner, review window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to docs + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures baseline, current, delta, and confidence for each KPI
- [ ] Artifact pack includes stabilization brief, risk ledger, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Day 56 delivery board

- [ ] Day 56 stabilization brief committed
- [ ] Day 56 stabilization plan reviewed with owner + backup
- [ ] Day 56 risk ledger exported
- [ ] Day 56 KPI scorecard snapshot exported
- [ ] Day 57 deep-audit priorities drafted from Day 56 learnings

## Scoring model

Day 56 weighted score (0-100):

- Contract + command lane completeness: 30 points.
- Discoverability alignment (README/docs index/top-10): 20 points.
- Day 55 continuity and strict baseline carryover: 35 points.
- Stabilization contract lock + delivery board readiness: 15 points.
