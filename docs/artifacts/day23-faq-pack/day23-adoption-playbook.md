# Day 23 adoption objection playbook

1. Collect objections from issues, PR reviews, and contributor onboarding notes.
2. Map each objection to one deterministic command and one docs page.
3. Run strict checks before launch posts or roadmap announcements.
4. Attach day23-faq-summary.json and execution evidence in review threads.
5. Revisit unresolved objections weekly and update this pack.
