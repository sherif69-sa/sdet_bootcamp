# Day 21 ultra upgrade report

## Day 21 big upgrade

Day 21 ships **weekly review #3** so teams can objectively track conversion improvements and external contributor response across Cycles 15-20.

## What shipped

- Extended `sdetkit weekly-review` to support `--week 3` (Day 15-20 shipped window).
- Added Day 21 growth-signal sample input for deterministic week-over-week deltas.
- Added Day 20/21 documentation entries in README and docs index.
- Added tests covering week-3 KPI behavior, growth-delta computation, and week-3 emitted closeout pack output.
