# Day 5 Ultra Upgrade Report — Platform Onboarding + Boost

## Upgrade title

**Day 5 big boost: cross-platform onboarding snippets integrated into CLI and docs artifacts**

## Problem statement

Day 1 provided role-based first commands, but mixed OS teams still had friction when setting up local environments.

Without platform-specific snippets, onboarding depended on tribal knowledge and ad-hoc edits.

## Implementation scope

### Files changed

- `src/sdetkit/onboarding.py`
  - Added `--platform` with `all|linux|macos|windows` options.
  - Added Day 5 platform setup snippets for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  - Expanded text/markdown/json rendering to include platform onboarding payloads.
- `tests/test_onboarding_cli.py`
  - Updated onboarding assertions to include Day 5 output surface.
  - Added coverage for JSON contract changes and `--platform windows` filtering behavior.
- `README.md`
  - Added Day 5 ultra section with runnable onboarding commands and artifact output path.
  - Added fast-entry mapping for platform-specific onboarding command.
- `docs/index.md`
  - Added Day 5 report link and Day 5 ultra section with command and artifact references.
- `docs/cli.md`
  - Added onboarding command reference including new `--platform` option and examples.
- `docs/artifacts/day5-platform-onboarding-sample.md`
  - Added generated Day 5 onboarding artifact sample.

## Validation checklist

- `python -m sdetkit onboarding --format markdown --platform all --output docs/artifacts/day5-platform-onboarding-sample.md`
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_onboarding_cli.py`

## Artifact

This document is the Day 5 artifact for cross-platform onboarding traceability and handoff.

## Rollback plan

1. Remove `--platform` logic and setup snippets from `src/sdetkit/onboarding.py`.
2. Revert Day 5 docs/report additions in README and docs pages.
3. Remove `docs/artifacts/day5-platform-onboarding-sample.md`.

Rollback risk is low because this is additive CLI/docs behavior and no breaking command rename was introduced.
