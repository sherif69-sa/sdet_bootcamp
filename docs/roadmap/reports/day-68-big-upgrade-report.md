# Day 68 big upgrade report

## Objective

Close Day 68 with a high-signal self-hosted integration lane that converts Day 67 outputs into a production-ready enterprise Tekton reference and a strict Day 69 handoff.

## What shipped

- New `day68-integration-expansion4-closeout` CLI lane with strict scoring and Day 67 continuity validation.
- New Day 68 integration guide with command lane, contract lock, quality checklist, and delivery board.
- New Day 68 contract checker script for CI and local execution gating.
- New integration artifact pack outputs for self-hosted blueprinting, policy planning, KPI scoring, and execution logging.
- New `templates/ci/tekton/day68-self-hosted-reference.yaml` self-hosted pipeline reference with identity, policy, and rollback controls.

## Validation flow

```bash
python -m sdetkit day68-integration-expansion4-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day68-integration-expansion4-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/day68-integration-expansion4-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit day68-integration-expansion4-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/day68-integration-expansion4-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_day68_integration_expansion4_closeout_contract.py
```

## Outcome

Day 68 is now an evidence-backed self-hosted integration expansion lane with strict continuity to Day 67 and deterministic handoff into Day 69 case-study prep #1.
