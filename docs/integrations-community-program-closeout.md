# Community Program Closeout (legacy) — Community program setup closeout lane


Day 62 ships a major community-program upgrade that converts Day 61 kickoff evidence into a strict baseline for office-hours, participation, and moderation execution.

## Why Community Program Closeout matters

- Converts Day 61 closeout evidence into repeatable community operations loops.
- Protects trust outcomes with ownership, command proof, and moderation rollback guardrails.
- Produces a deterministic handoff from Day 62 community setup into Day 63 onboarding activation.
