# Cycle 8 — Continuous upgrade closeout lane

Cycle 8 closes with a major upgrade that converts Cycle 7 continuous-upgrade outcomes into a deterministic next-cycle execution lane.

## Why Cycle 8 matters

- Converts Cycle 7 outcomes into reusable publication decisions across release recap, roadmap governance, and maintainer escalation paths.
- Protects quality with strict contract coverage, runnable commands, KPI thresholds, and rollback safety.
- Creates a deterministic handoff from Cycle 8 closeout into the continuous-upgrade backlog.

## Required inputs (Cycle 7)

- `docs/artifacts/continuous-upgrade-cycle7-closeout-pack/cycle7-continuous-upgrade-cycle7-closeout-summary.json`
- `docs/artifacts/continuous-upgrade-cycle7-closeout-pack/cycle7-delivery-board.md`
- `docs/roadmap/plans/continuous-upgrade-cycle8-plan.json`

## Cycle 8 command lane

```bash
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle8-closeout --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle8-closeout --emit-pack-dir docs/artifacts/continuous-upgrade-cycle8-closeout-pack --format json --strict
python -m sdetkit continuous-upgrade-cycle8-closeout --execute --evidence-dir docs/artifacts/continuous-upgrade-cycle8-closeout-pack/evidence --format json --strict
python scripts/check_continuous_upgrade_cycle8_closeout_contract.py
```

## Continuous upgrade contract

- Single owner + backup reviewer are assigned for Cycle 8 continuous upgrade execution and signoff.
- The Cycle 8 lane references Cycle 7 outcomes, controls, and trust continuity signals.
- Every Cycle 8 section includes docs/template CTA, runnable command CTA, KPI threshold, and rollback guardrail.
- Cycle 8 closeout records continuous upgrade outputs, report publication status, and backlog inputs.

## Continuous upgrade quality checklist

- [ ] Includes baseline evidence coverage, objection segmentation assumptions, and response SLA targets
- [ ] Every upgrade lane row has owner, execution window, KPI threshold, and risk flag
- [ ] CTA links point to upgrade docs/templates + runnable command evidence
- [ ] Scorecard captures continuous upgrade adoption delta, confidence, and rollback owner
- [ ] Artifact pack includes upgrade brief, evidence plan, template diffs, outcome ledger, KPI scorecard, and execution log

## Cycle 8 delivery board

- [ ] Cycle 8 evidence brief committed
- [ ] Cycle 8 continuous upgrade plan committed
- [ ] Cycle 8 upgrade template upgrade ledger exported
- [ ] Cycle 8 storyline outcomes ledger exported
- [ ] Next-cycle roadmap draft captured from Cycle 8 outcomes

## Scoring model

Cycle 8 weights continuity + execution contract + governance artifact readiness for a 100-point activation score.
