# Day 79 big upgrade report

Day 79 delivers a closeout-grade scale upgrade lane that promotes Day 78 ecosystem outcomes into enterprise onboarding execution readiness with strict contract checks, deterministic command evidence, and Day 80 handoff coverage.

## What shipped

- New command: `python -m sdetkit day79-scale-upgrade-closeout`.
- New integration guide: `docs/integrations-day79-scale-upgrade-closeout.md`.
- New contract checker: `python scripts/check_day79_scale_upgrade_closeout_contract.py`.
- New artifact schema emitted via `--emit-pack-dir` and deterministic evidence via `--execute`.

## Why this is a big upgrade

- Establishes a continuity gate from Day 78 ecosystem priorities before Day 79 can pass strict mode.
- Adds a weighted scoring model (0-100) with explicit quality and rollout controls.
- Produces a deterministic artifact pack for downstream Day 80 partner-outreach execution.
